/*
We cheat a bit here and use Unicode characters as sort indicators. The concept is the same for other methods for
displaying the graphics, though. We use CSS to control which ones are showing and what they look like, rather than
manipulating the DOM in JavaScript. We take advantage of the `aria-sort` attribute set on the <th> element that encloses
these indicators.
