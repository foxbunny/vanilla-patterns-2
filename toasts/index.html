				<p>
					Toasts are messages that are displayed outside the regular flow of
					content to provide timely information about an event on the page.
					This implementation uses an ARIA live message so that the toast
					message is announced immediately to screen reader users. The end of
					the animation of the progress bar doubles as an event to trigger the
					removal of the toast element from the page.
				</p>

				<p>
					An empty element is used to hold a list of toasts. The toast list
					element is used so that multiple toasts can be added to the page
					without overlapping each other.
				</p>

				<p>
					Although using toasts is tempting, you should generally avoid it
					whenever showing feedback right next to the form control is an
					option. The reason for this is that some users use screen magnifiers
					that allows them to only see a small portion of the screen at once.
					For these users, toasts are usually too far outside the visible area
					for them to notice.
